#coop will place files in this include root

#here you can list specific include files, that need to be considered for matching - e.g. include-files include/foo.h
#include-files




#if this is set coop will not do any changes to the source files - only analyze
analyze-only


#if there are a lot of single instance allocations of hot data you might want to pool them 
#pool-hot-data

#if set coop will ask for permission on EACH record when trying to optimize it
#confirm-record-changes


#if there are sources you would like to ignore list them here and uncomment the command. Should be a child of root folder - e.g. exclude-folders thirdPartySrc/
#exclude-folders exampleFolder anotherExampleFolder




#this value determines the allocationsize, that is given any hot data freelist, that is created by coop
#coop will guarantee the free list to hold enough space for hot-elements 
#hot-elements 1024



#this value determines the allocationsize, that is given any cold data freelist, that is created by coop
#coop will guarantee the free list to hold enough space for cold-elements 
#since 'deep' copies of hot data might lead to new creation of cold data it is advised to make this at least double the hot-elements
#cold-elements 2048




#this value can be set to modify the split tolerance - a record that is split will be split by its field weight.
#a slightly weaker field could be split even though we want it to be considered hot.
#the split tolerance is a factor that will lower the actual border for fields to be considered hot
split-tolerance 0.17




#decides depth dependent weighting of members - this factor is accounted for each loop-depth
#depth-factor 10.0
